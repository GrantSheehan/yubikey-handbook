# Yubikey Handbook

_Featured on the [3rd-Party Labs (3PL) - YubiKey Innovations and Inspirations](https://forum.yubico.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1942) compilation_.

Yubikey is an hardware device manufactured by Yubico that provides several forms of strong authentication and encryption. It has many use cases and interesting applications.

The _Yubikey Handbook_ is an attempt of exploring those use cases and is intended to be a living document. It is focused on the Yubikey 4/Yubikey 4 Nano. With some adaptations, parts of this document will also apply to the Yubikey NEO.
