## OpenGPG

OpenPGP is an open standard for encrypting and signing. Although there has been some [recent](https://www.yubico.com/2016/05/secure-hardware-vs-open-source/) [debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4ls94a/yubico_has_replaced_all_opensource_components/) [around it](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5gw2e3/im_giving_up_on_pgp_filippo_valsorda/), it works very well with the Yubikey.
