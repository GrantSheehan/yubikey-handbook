## About the author

Rui Marinho is a software engineer by day, a security engineer by night and a network engineer on weekends. This blend of interests has allowed him to plan and build large-scale infrastructure projects, having specialized in mission-critical and highly available systems with security as one of its top priorities.

He began his professional career in 2008 when he co-founded Seegno, a software development company, while still finishing his MSc in Biomedical Engineering. Six years later, in 2014, he joined the team that built and launched Uphold, a fintech startup created by Halsey Minor (CNET, Salesforce), that offers programmable money in the cloud.

He has since then been helping manage a team of engineers where he continually works to raise the bar on stability, performance and quality. His passion for open source has led to many contributions across different projects, as well as several new ones of his authorship.

When he's not coding, he's usually taking on security challenges (CTF), reading bug bounties, playing around with house automation, having dinner with friends, cooking or travelling.
